## CLUnit
CLUnit is a Common Lisp unit testing framework. It is designed to be easy to use so that you can quickly start testing.

CLUnit provides a rich set of features aimed at improving your unit testing experience:
+ Multiple inheritance for test suites allows you to group tests into hierarchies.
+ Composes the test results of each test run into a single report.
+ Allows redefinition of inline functions and macros without having to redefine your tests.
+ Supports composable test suite fixtures.
+ Allows for an interactive testing process which gives you access to the test environment.
+ Provides visual feeback of the unit test progress.
+ Extensible test reporting. Builtin support for default reporting and [TAP][2] output.
