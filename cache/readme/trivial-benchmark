About Trivial-Benchmark
-----------------------
Frequently I want to do a quick benchmark comparison of my functions. `TIME` is nice to get some data, but it's limited to a single run so there isn't really much of a statistical value in it. Trivial-benchmark runs a block of code many times and outputs some statistical data for it. On SBCL this includes the data from `TIME`, for all other implementations just the REAL- and RUN-TIME data. However, you can extend the system by adding your own `metric`s to it, or even by adding additional statistical `compute`ations. 

How To
------
For basic throwaway benchmarking, the `with-timing` macro should suffice:

    (benchmark:with-timing (1000)
      (+ 1 1))

However, you can also do more complex timing using `make-timer` and `with-sampling`. The former creates a new timer object (with an optional list of metrics to sample) and the latter collects one sample for each metric of the timer for the duration of the body forms.

    (defvar *timer* (benchmark:make-timer))
    
    (benchmark:with-sampling (*timer*)
      (+ 1 1))
    
    (benchmark:with-sampling (*timer*)
      (expt 10 100))
    
    (benchmark:report *timer*)
    
    (benchmark:reset *timer*)
    
    (benchmark:report *timer*)

Extending Trivial-Benchmark
---------------------------
If you're interested in adding additional metrics, you'll want to take a look at the `metric` class, as well as the related methods, `start` `discard` `commit` `take-sample` `samples` `sample-size` `condense` `reduce-samples` `compute` `report` `reset`. For a basic `metric`, you only need to implement `start`, `discard`, `commit`, `samples`, and `take-sample`. The other functions have standard methods that will do their computations based on those five.

If you have a function that returns a current state of your sample and simply want to have the metric show the delta between `start` and `commit`, you can use `define-delta-metric`.

    (define-delta-metric run-time
      (/ (get-internal-run-time)
         internal-time-units-per-second))

You can also implement a new computation type that is used to display the different metrics in the table. For that, simply write a method on `compute` with the name of your computation as an eql-specializer and then push the name onto `*default-computations*` so that it's always displayed when using `report`. As an example, the maximum is simply calculated as follows:

    (defmethod compute ((x (eql :maximum)) (metric metric))
      (reduce-samples metric #'max))
