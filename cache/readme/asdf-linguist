# asdf-linguist

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eudoxia0/asdf-linguist.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eudoxia0/asdf-linguist)

ASDF-linguist is a set of extensions to the ASDF build system for Common Lisp
for compiling various languages and running various preprocessing tools (Sass,
LESS, etc.) on files in your project.

ASDF is very easy to extend to handle other languages within the same project,
eg. compiling C source files, but this ease of extensibility leads to people
reimplementing these basic capabilities in different, ad-hoc ways. This system
attempts to solve this by providing one and only one way to do these things.
