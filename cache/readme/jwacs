jwacs - Javascript With Advanced Continuation Support

Jwacs is a program for transforming code written in an extended version of 
Javascript that contains continuation support into regular Javascript that can 
be run in any standards-compliant browser.

The extended language is also called jwacs, which is perhaps a little confusing. 
Suggestions are welcome.

See doc/index.html or http://chumsley.org/jwacs/ for documentation, including a Quick 
Start guide.
