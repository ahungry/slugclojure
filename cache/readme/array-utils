About Array-Utils
-----------------
A miniature toolkit that contains some useful shifting/popping/pushing functions for arrays and vectors. This exists mostly because I've used these functions in multiple places already, so splitting it off into its own thing is a good idea. Originally from [Plump](http://shinmera.github.io/plump/).
