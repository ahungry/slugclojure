## Compatibility

The application has been tested on SBCL, CCL and CLISP. Please let me
know of any issues on other Common Lisp implementations.

## Starting the server

After loading the package, run the following command from the REPL:

(docbrowser:start-docserver)

This will start the docserver on port 8080. A different port number
can also be given as an optional argument.

To access the docbrowser, point a web browser to
http://localhost:8080/
