Trivial-bit-streams is a library which implements flexible
buffered bit streams.

Input into INPUT-BIT-STREAM's buffer and output from OUTPUT-BIT-STREAM's one
is managed through callbacks, so you can easily wrap bit streams around any
desirable data type.

The library's single dependency is trivial-gray-streams library.
