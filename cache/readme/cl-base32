CL-Base32 is a Common Lisp library for encoding / decoding bytes to / from base32 strings
(e.g., RFC 4648).

One advantage of base32 encoding is that the resulting strings do not require URL encoding
for use in an URL, as the base32 alphabet contains no characters that must be encoded
to appear in an URL.

This package is intended to be portable across as many Common Lisp implementations
and platforms as possible.  Any issues with such portability should be reported
phil@haphazardhouse.net.

Known to work on CCL & SBCL for Mac OS X.
