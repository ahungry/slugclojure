# closp 

**closp has been changed significantly in 0.4 and upwards.**

Get started with: `lein new closp -n yourprojectname -n name.space` 

Then open a repl and after startup enter: `(start-dev-system)` to startup the server.  
The clojurescript is compiled by running `lein figwheel` in the projects command line.

It comes with: 
- component
- postgresql as database
- re-frame as cljs library
- figwheel for reloading
- etaoin for frontend tests
- bidi for routing (back / frontend)
- buddy for login / logout (jwt token is used and the complete UI for login / logout is integrated in the template)
- tempura for i18n
- phrase for form validation
