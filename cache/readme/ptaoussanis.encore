# Encore

### Core utils library for Clojure/Script

**Or**: What happens when you spend way too much time with Clojure

**Please note**: this is a library intended mostly for my own use or **for advanced users** who are comfortable reading the source code to see what's available + how to use it.

## Experiencing a dependency conflict?

Please see [here](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/encore/blob/master/DEP-CONFLICT.md) for help.

## Contacting me / contributions

Please use the project's [GitHub issues page] for all questions, ideas, etc. **Pull requests welcome**. See the project's [GitHub contributors page] for a list of contributors.

Otherwise, you can reach me at [Taoensso.com]. Happy hacking!

\- [Peter Taoussanis]
