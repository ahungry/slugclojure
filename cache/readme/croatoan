croatoan is a set of bindings to the ncurses terminal library for
Common Lisp.

It is inspired, but not derived from, cl-ncurses and cl-charms.

Its main goal is to provide a higher-level, lispy/CLOSy interface,
whereas the existing bindings clone the cryptic C API.

As of now, the library is in an early, but hopefully usable stage. 
Ncurses is old and huge and it will take a while to cover completely.

The API is not yet stable.

It was tested on Linux, with SBCL 1.1.8 and ncurses 5.9.

The documentation is provided by the examples.

You are welcome to contribute and any form of help is appreciated.
