# Websocket Driver

This library provides a complete implementation of the WebSocket protocols.

## Usage

### Server-side with Clack

```common-lisp
(ql:quickload '(:websocket-driver :clack))

(use-package :websocket-driver)

(defvar *echo-server*
  (lambda (env)
    (let ((ws (make-server env)))
      (on :message ws
          (lambda (ev)
            (send ws (event-data ev))))
      (lambda (responder)
        (declare (ignore responder))
        (start-connection ws)))))

(clack:clackup *echo-server* :server :wookie :port 5000)
```

### Server-side with Wookie

```common-lisp
(ql:quickload '(:websocket-driver :wookie))

(use-package '(:wookie :websocket-driver))

(defroute (:get "/echo" :chunk nil) (req res)
  (declare (ignore res))
  (let ((ws (make-server req :type :wookie)))
    (on :message ws
        (lambda (event)
          (send ws (event-data event))))
    (start-connection ws)))

(as:with-event-loop ()
  (start-server (make-instance 'listener :port 5000)))
```

### Client-side

```common-lisp
(defvar *client* (wsd:make-client "ws://localhost:5000/echo"))
```

## Driver API

#### `(on :open driver callback)`

Sets the `CALLBACK` function to execute when the socket becomes open.

#### `(on :message driver callback)`

Sets the `CALLBACK` to execute when a message is received. The `CALLBACK` function takes a `MESSAGE-EVENT` as an argument which has an accessor `EVENT-DATA` to get the data that is either a string in the case of a text message or an `(UNSIGNED-BYTE 8)` vector in the case of a binary message.

#### `(on :error driver callback)`

Sets the `CALLBACK` to execute when a protocol error occurs due to the other peer sending an invalid byte sequence. The `CALLBACK` function takes a `PROTOCOL-ERROR` as an argument.

#### `(on :close driver callback)`

Sets the `CALLBACK` to execute when the socket becomes closed. The `CALLBACK` function takes a `CLOSE-EVENT` as an argument which has accessors `EVENT-CODE` and `EVENT-REASON`.

#### `(start-connection driver)`

Initiates the protocol by sending the handshake - either the response for a server-side driver or the request for a client-side one. This should be the first method you invoke. Returns `T` if a handshake was sent.

#### `(parse driver data)`

Takes `DATA` and parses it, potentially resulting in message events being emitted (see `(on :message ...)` above). You should send all data you receive via I/O to this method.

#### `(send driver data &key type code)`

Sends `DATA` over the socket.

#### `(send-text driver string)`

Sends a text message over the socket.

#### `(send-binary driver usb8-vector)`

Takes an `(UNSIGNED-BYTE 8)` vector and sends them as a binary message.

#### `(send-ping driver &optional message callback)`

Sends a ping frame over the socket, queueing it if necessary.

#### `(close-connection driver)`

Initiates the closing handshake if the socket is still open.

#### `(version driver)`

Returns the WebSocket version in use as a string.

#### `(protocol driver)`

Returns a string containing the selected subprotocol, if any was agreed upon using the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` mechanism.
