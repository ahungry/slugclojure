terminfo
========

A [terminfo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminfo) database front end in Common Lisp.  The package provides a method for determining which capabilities a terminal (e.g. "xterm") has and methods to compile or put commands to a stream.

Based on [terminfo](http://users.actrix.co.nz/mycroft/terminfo.lisp) by Paul Foley, terminfo was later modified for use in linedit and the hemlock text editor.  This library consolidates changes to the terminfo package to provide a flexible interface.
