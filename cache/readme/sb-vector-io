Writing and reading raw vector data in SBCL.

Works with vectors -- both non-simple and simple, if the element type
of the vector is such that it conforms to "normal" way of representing
such data on the platform. Endianness is unspecified, floating points
use the IEEE format.

NOTE: The package nickname VECTOR-IO is deprecated, and will be deleted.
