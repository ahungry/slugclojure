The [API documentation index](http://marick.github.io/suchwow) gives an overview of what this library offers.

Snippets from serious work, wrapped in a whimsical container. A bit of a tribute to the spirit of [_why](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff), but with a [Shiba Inu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiba_Inu) instead of [foxes](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/images/the.foxes-3.png).

This package offers three types of functions:
* `clojure.core` functions, but with better documentation (including examples).
* Variants of `clojure.core` functions that accept more kinds of inputs.
* A grab-bag of useful functions that, importantly, you can copy into your own code without worrying about licenses or giving credit or any of that. As a programmer trying to get work done, I use this library and others to create a ["favorite functions" namespace](https://github.com/marick/clojure-commons/blob/master/src/commons/clojure/core.clj) that I `use` everywhere.

## Such Usage

Available via [clojars](https://clojars.org/marick/suchwow) for Clojure 1.7+  
For lein: [marick/suchwow "6.0.0"]

[Much API doc](http://marick.github.io/suchwow/)

Copy the source if you want, do the normal `(:require
[such.types :as wow])` thing, or create your own `commons.clojure.core`
namespace with all the things you think should be packaged with Clojure. 

The files [test/such/clojure/f_immigration.clj](https://github.com/marick/suchwow/blob/master/test/such/f_immigration.clj) and [commons.clojure.core](https://github.com/marick/clojure-commons/blob/master/src/commons/clojure/core.clj) show how to arrange for that last.

1. Your contribution has tests. In keeping with the spirit of the library, they
   don't even have to be written with
   [Midje](https://github.com/marick/Midje), since Midje can run
   clojure.test tests.

2. Your contribution doesn't depend on anything other than Clojure itself.

3. You have the right to put your contribution into the public domain.
