dlist - A Common Lisp library that implements doubly-linked lists
=================================================================

dlist is a Common Lisp library that implements the doubly-linked list
data structure. dlist provides many operations on doubly-linked lists,
or dlists, which are documented in the file documentation.html , which
is available with the source. If your lisp implementation supports
[user-extensible sequences][1] (which only SBCL and ABCL do
currently), you will be able to use the standard Common Lisp sequence
functions (map, reduce, etc.) with dlists. dlist does not have any
dependencies other than a common lisp implementation.

Obtaining and installing dlist
------------------------------

dlist is available from [http://github.com/krzysz00/dlist](GitHub) and can be
installed via Quicklisp (not yet). To use dlist, simply load the ASDF
system. Use:

    (asdf:oos 'asdf:test-op :dlist)

to run the test suite.

dlist is licensed under the 3-Clause BSD Licence, see the file COPYING
for details.
