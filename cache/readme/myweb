Meaning?
	It was written so that i could become more acquainted with Common Lisp 
	It doesn't support parsing of POST requests (if you need it you can implement it)
	It's not 100% accurate and it might be buggy so it's not for a production use
	It's not striving to become anything more than a hobby 

Things you need
	sbcl (or any other Common Lisp implementation)
	quicklisp (will download all needed dependencies for you)

Depends on 
	swank
	usocket
	bordeaux-threads
	trivial-utf-8
	cl-log
	local-time
	
To start type
	sbcl --load load.lisp
	
And then to start web server type
	(myweb:start-http "localhost" 8080)

Open your browser at http://localhost:8080

Additional start options
	you can specify worker limit (maximum number of threads that will process http requests) and idle worker number using
	(myweb:start-http "localhost" 8080 :worker-limit 100 :idle-workers 10)
	
Where do i start if i want to have my code?
	Well first of all you should see handler.lisp
	This file contains all request processing logic and you can modify
	it to suite your needs
	
What encondings it support?
	well since it uses trivial-utf-8 it supports only utf-8 enconding sorry
	
How can i test load on it?
	well if you have apache2 installed you could try doing
	ab -n 10000 -c 10 http://localhost:8080

How can i log something when i'm processing my request?
	Use myweb.util:log-info myweb.util:log-warning and myweb.util:log-error functions
