# Euclidean

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/weavejester/euclidean.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/weavejester/euclidean)

A Clojure library for performing calculations suitable for 3D games
using fast, immutable data structures.

Euclidean is written in pure Clojure, but has performance comparable
to vector libraries written in Java, such as [Vectorz][1].

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file:

    [euclidean "0.2.0"]

## Usage

Euclidean provides two namespaces, one for constructing vectors, the
other for [quaternions][2]:

```clojure
(require '[euclidean.math.vector :as v])
(require '[euclidean.math.quaternion :as q])
```

[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion

The library includes data readers for 2D and 3D vectors, and 4D
quaternions:

```clojure
#math/vector [1 2]          ;; 2D vector
#math/vector [1 2 3]        ;; 3D vector
#math/quaternion [0 0 0 1]  ;; Quaternion
```

But you can also create data structures through various contructor
functions:

```clojure
(v/vector 1 2)
(v/vector 1 2 3)
(v/into-vector [1 2])
(v/into-vector [1 2 3])

(q/quaternion 0 0 0 1)
(q/into-quaternion [0 0 0 1])
```

These data structures implement standard Clojure interfaces, so you
can use functions like `get`, `count` and `seq` on them:

```clojure
(def v (v/vector 1 2 3))

(get v 0)            ;; => 1.0
(v 1)                ;; => 2.0
(count v)            ;; => 3
(seq v)              ;; => (1.0 2.0 3.0)
(= v [1.0 2.0 3.0])  ;; => true
```

Note how the numbers in the vector are stored as doubles. This is for
performance purposes.

Euclidean provides a number of additional functions for manipulating
and creating vectors and quaternions. For a full list, see the API
documentation linked below.
