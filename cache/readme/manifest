Manifest is a system for semi-automatically documenting Common Lisp
packages. (A manifest tells you what's in a package. Also this system
makes manifest a bunch of information that is actually present in a
Lisp system.) The basic premise is that every exported symbol in a
package should be documented.

To check it out, after loading the system, evaluate (start) and point
your browser at the URL it returns.
