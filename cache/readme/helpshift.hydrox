## Overview 

[hydrox](https://www.github.com/helpshift/hydrox) assists in the transmission of knowledge around a clojure project, providing in-repl management of documentation, docstrings and metadata through the reuse/repurposing of test code. The tool allows for a design-orientated workflow for the programming process, blurring the boundaries between design, development, testing and documentation.
