What
----
css-selectors + buildnode ported to STP and dressed up to look like jQuery.

Why
---
STP is both a nicer API than DOM and has better namespace handling.  And
there's no point in re-inventing an API when someone else has already done
such a good job of it.

Licence
-------
LGPL.  I usually prefer MIT, but both css-selectors and buildnode are LGPL
and they're 90% of this iceberg.

Usage
-----
Basically, use the "lisp-name" of the corresponding jQuery method from the $
package.  So, addClass becomes $:add-class.  That's all there is to it.

($:query selector nodes) searches using CSS3 syntax.  Not $:$ because that
looks stupid.

The only really odd thing, from a Lisp perspective, is that $:map behaves
like jQuery's map.  Which is to say that it is sometimes mapcar and sometimes
mapcan, depending.

To get jQuery style chaining, try the -> macro from my backports library.

And just so there's no confusion, yes my docstrings were stolen whole-hog
from jQuery.  Originality is not a goal here.
