## Introduction ##

FSet is a functional set-theoretic collections library.  _Functional_ means that all
update operations return a new collection rather than modifying an existing one in
place.  _Set-theoretic_ means that collections may be nested arbitrarily with no
additional programmer effort; for instance, sets may contain sets, maps may be keyed
by sets, etc.

The [FSet home page](http://common-lisp.net/project/fset/Site/index.html) explains
why I chose functional semantics for FSet.

To get started using FSet, check out the [FSet
Tutorial](http://common-lisp.net/project/fset/Site/FSet-Tutorial.html).  Once you've
gone through that, I recommend the [FSet/CL
page](http://common-lisp.net/project/fset/Site/FSet-CL.html), which explains how FSet
is integrated into Common Lisp.

For more details, see the [FSet project page](http://common-lisp.net/project/fset).

There might be some useful information on the [FSet CLiki page](http://cliki.net/FSet).
