# overload-middleware

Clojure/Ring middleware that automatically rejects some requests with "503 Service Not Available" in order to keep latency below a specific target.

This implements the algorithm given in ["Adaptive Overload Control For Busy Internet Servers"](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~mdw/papers/control-usits03.pdf) - requests are accepted or rejected based on a token bucket, and the rate at which that bucket refills is regularly changed based on the difference between the target latency and the current 90th-percentile latency.

One enhancement which this library makes over that algorithm is that,
if the application reports a 503 error (for example, because a
database is reporting overload), the middleware recognises that and
treats it as high-latency, rather than low-latency (which would have
the effect of allowing more requests). This is based on a similar
approach taken by [the Crest HTTP server](https://github.com/Metaswitch/crest/).

## Usage

```clojure
(ns my-ring-app.core
  (:require [overload-middleware.middleware :refer wrap-overload]))

(defn myapp [req] {:status 200 :body "Hello World" :headers {}})

;; Aim to have 90% of requests served in 100ms or less
(def wrapped-app (wrap-overload app {:target-latency 100}))
```

wrap-overload takes a Ring app to wrap, and an options map with three
possible keys:

- :target-latency (mandatory) - the target latency in milliseconds
  (i.e. the number of milliseconds you want 90% of your requests to be
  served within)
- :override-bucket-parameters (optional) - a map containing parameters to control
  the size and initial state of the token bucket.
- :override-algorithm-parameters (optional) - a map containing parameters to
  control how the refill rate of the token bucket is affected by the latency.

The structure of override-algorithm-parameters and
override-bucket-parameters, and their default values, is documented
[in the Marginalia docs](http://rkday.github.io/overload-middleware/docs/uberdoc.html#overload-middleware.schemas).
