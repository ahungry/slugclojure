Gordon is a library for generating Flash files programmatically. It supports a large subset of the Flash 7.0 specification.

Gordon is now installable via quicklisp (http://www.quicklisp.org)

See the code in ./demos for examples, or torta (http://www.github.com/sgarciac/torta) for a larger program that uses gordon.
