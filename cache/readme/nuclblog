nuclblog is a blog engine written in Common Lisp. nuclblog aims to be
a clean, relatively lightweight blog engine based on the hunchentoot
web server.

To install it you need to do/get the following:

1. Prerequisites:

  * hunchentoot
  * cl-who
  * cl-store

and for the demo:

  * ch-asdf

2. Install the nuclblog.asd file

Install the nuclblog.asd file in the usual place .asd
files go on your system (e.g., /usr/local/lib/sbcl/site-systems)

3. SSL

edit demo/ssl/openssl.config and then:

To create a new cert:

cd demo/ssl
openssl genrsa -out key.pem 1024      
openssl req -config openssl.config -new -key key.pem -out request.pem
openssl req -x509 -days 365 -key key.pem -in request.pem -out certificate.pem

4. Running the demo

execute the following:

(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :nuclblog-demo)

(nuclblog-demo:start-services)

or

(nuclblog-demo:start-services :use-ssl t)

(nuclblog::add-user nuclblog-demo::*blog* "demo" "demo")

and you should be ready to go!
