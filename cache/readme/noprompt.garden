# Garden

Garden is a library for rendering CSS in Clojure and ClojureScript.
Conceptually similar to [Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup), it uses
vectors to represent rules and maps to represent declarations. It is designed
for stylesheet authors who are interested in what's possible when you trade a
preprocessor for a programming language.

## Getting Started

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file:

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/garden/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/garden)

Garden 1.2.5 and below requires Clojure 1.6.0 and is known to work with
ClojureScript 0.0-2342. However, starting with Garden 1.3.0 Garden requires
Clojure 1.7 and ClojureScript 1.7.x to leverage a unified syntax with
[reader conditionals](http://dev.clojure.org/display/design/Reader+Conditionals),
and other major changes in the compiler and repl in Clojurescript.

## Syntax

Garden syntax is very similar to
[Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup). If you're familiar with Hiccup
you should feel right at home. If not, don't sweat it! Garden's syntax is
simple.

From your project's root directory start up a new REPL and try the following:

```clojure
user=> (require '[garden.core :refer [css]])
nil
user=> (css [:body {:font-size "16px"}])
"body{font-size:16px}"
```

First you'll notice the use of the `css` function. This function takes an
optional map of compiler flags, any number of rules, and returns a string of
compiled CSS.

Vectors represent rules in CSS. The first _n_ **non-collection** elements of a
vector depict the rule's selector where _n_ > 0. When _n_ = 0 the rule is not
rendered. To produce a rule which selects the `<h1>` and `<h2>` HTML elements
for example, we simply begin a vector with `[:h1 :h2]`:

```clojure
user=> (css [:h1 :h2 {:font-weight "none"}])
"h1,h2{font-weight:none}"
```

To target **child selectors** nested vectors may be employed:

```clojure
user=> (css [:h1 [:a {:text-decoration "none"}]])
"h1 a{text-decoration:none}"
user=> (css [:h1 :h2 [:a {:text-decoration "none"}]])
"h1 a, h2 a{text-decoration:none}"
```

As in Less/Sass, Garden also supports selectors prefixed with the `&`
character allowing you to reference a **parent selector**:

```clojure
user=> (css [:a
             {:font-weight 'normal
              :text-decoration 'none}
             [:&:hover
              {:font-weight 'bold
               :text-decoration 'underline}]])
"a{text-decoration:none;font-weight:normal}a:hover{text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold}"
```

A slightly more complex example demonstrating nested vectors with multiple
selectors:

```clojure
user=> (css [:h1 :h2 {:font-weight "normal"}
             [:strong :b {:font-weight "bold"}]])
"h1,h2{font-weight:normal}h1 strong,h1 b,h2 strong,h2 b{font-weight:bold}"
```

`garden.selectors` namespace defines a CSSSelector record. It doubles as both a
function and a literal (when passed to the css-selector). When the function is
called it will return a new instance that possesses the same properties. All
arguments to the function must satisfy ICSSSelector.

`garden.selectors` namespace also defines these macros that create a selector
record: `defselector`, `defclass`, `defid`, `defpseudoclass` and
`defpseudoelement`.

`garden.selectors` namespace also defines many CSSSelector instances such as:

* Type selectors `a`, `abbr`, `address` and [more](src/garden/selectors.cljc)
* Pseudo-classes `active`, `checked`, `disabled` and
  [more](src/garden/selectors.cljc)
* Language and negation pseudo-classes `lang` and `not`
* Structural pseudo-classes `nth-child`, `nth-last-child`, `nth-of-type` and
  `nth-last-of-type`
* Pseudo-elements `after`, `before`, `first-letter` and `first-line`
* Attribute selectors `attr=`, `attr-contains`, `attr-starts-with`,
  `attr-starts-with*`, `attr-ends-with` and `attr-matches`
* Combinators `descendant`, `+`, `-` and `>`
* Special selector `&`

and allows to compose complex selectors such as this:

```clojure
(defselector *)
(defpseudoclass host [x] x)
(defpseudoelement content)
(> (host (attr :flipped)) content (* last-child))
;; => :host([flipped]) > ::content > *:last-child
```

`garden.selectors` namespace also defines a CSS3 selectors's `specificity`
function:

```clojure
(specificity "#s12:not(FOO)")
;; => 101
(specificity (a hover))
;; => 10
```

Clojure maps represent CSS declarations where map keys and values represent CSS
properties and values respectively. Garden's declaration syntax is a bit more
involved than rules and understanding it is important to make the most of the
library.

Declaration map keys _should_ either be a string, keyword, or symbol:

```clojure
user=> (css [:h1 {"font-weight" "normal"}])
"h1{font-weight:normal}"
user=> (css [:h1 {:font-weight "normal"}])
"h1{font-weight:normal}"
user=> (css [:h1 {'font-weight "normal"}])
"h1{font-weight:normal}"
```

Be aware, Garden makes no attempt to validate your declarations and
will not raise an error if other key types are used.

```clojure
user=> (css [:h1 {30000 "nom-nom"}])
"h1{30000:nom-nom}"
```

We've already seen strings used as declaration map values, but Garden also
supports keywords, symbols, numbers, maps, vectors, and lists in addition.

##### Custom functions

Since Garden doesn't have wrappers for all the possible CSS functions,
sometimes you might need to define the function you need yourself.
This is where the `defcssfn` macro comes in handy.
Suppose you want to use the `url` CSS function, even if it's not available
in Garden directly you can just define it yourself by simply:

```
(defcssfn url)
;; => #'user/url
```

Which will render like this:
```
(css (url "http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato"))
;; => url(http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato)
```

##### Strings, keywords, symbols, and numbers

Strings, keywords, symbols, and numbers are rendered as literal CSS values:

```clojure
user=> (css [:body {:font "16px sans-serif"}])
"body{font:16px sans-serif}"
```

Be warned, you must escape literal string values yourself:

```clojure
user=> (css [:pre {:font-family "\"Liberation Mono\", Consolas, monospace"}])
"pre{font-family:\"Liberation Mono\", Consolas, monospace}"

```
