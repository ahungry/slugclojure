Subrosa is an IRC daemon written in Clojure.

It's event driven, backed by the Netty server framework.

It's also nowhere near complete and totally unsuitable for anything
other than hacking on.

Self-signed Keystores (for SSL) can be created with the mkks.sh shell
script provided in the release tarballs (and in pkg/bin/ in the source
distribution).
