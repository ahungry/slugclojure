INTRODUCTION
============

Conium is a portability library for debugger- and compiler-related
tasks in Common Lisp.

It is fork of SWANK-BACKEND and differs from swank in the following
regards:

  - The swank frontend has been removed, leaving a Lisp library rather
    than a socket server.

  - Conium always uses ASDF instead of a manual load script.

  - Code related to threads has been removed.  (Use bordeaux-threads instead.)

  - Code related to the MOP has been removed.  (Use closer-mop instead.)

  - Code related to gray streams has been removed.  (Use
    trivial-gray-streams instead.)

  - Code related sockets has been removed.  (Use usocket, iolib, or
    in Hemlock's case, the connection API instead.)

  - The package SWANK-BACKEND has been renamed to CONIUM.


It is currently being maintained by David Lichteblau and retains its
original public domain status.
