<ul>
<li><p>Tests
 Some of the socket tests require an echo server, the default being
one on the Internet. If you can&apos;t use that, set
iolib-tests:<em>echo-address</em> and iolib-test:<em>echo-port</em> appropriately to
point the echo tests somewhere else.</p></li>
<li><p>Generating documentation
 To generate the documentation, use this patched version of
texinfo-docstrings: http://gitorious.org/iolib/texinfo-docstrings
Then make sure that IOLib&apos;s .asd files and texinfo-docstrings.asd can
be loaded and run GNU make inside doc/ ; you&apos;ll then find the
generated docs under manual/. This procedure has only been tested
with SBCL.</p></li>
