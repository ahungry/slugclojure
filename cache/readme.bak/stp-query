<h2>What</h2>

<p>css-selectors + buildnode ported to STP and dressed up to look like jQuery.</p>

<h2>Why</h2>

<p>STP is both a nicer API than DOM and has better namespace handling.  And
there&apos;s no point in re-inventing an API when someone else has already done
such a good job of it.</p>

<h2>Licence</h2>

<p>LGPL.  I usually prefer MIT, but both css-selectors and buildnode are LGPL
and they&apos;re 90% of this iceberg.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Basically, use the &ldquo;lisp-name&rdquo; of the corresponding jQuery method from the $
package.  So, addClass becomes $:add-class.  That&apos;s all there is to it.</p>

<p>($:query selector nodes) searches using CSS3 syntax.  Not $:$ because that
looks stupid.</p>

<p>The only really odd thing, from a Lisp perspective, is that $:map behaves
like jQuery&apos;s map.  Which is to say that it is sometimes mapcar and sometimes
mapcan, depending.</p>

<p>To get jQuery style chaining, try the &rarr; macro from my backports library.</p>

<p>And just so there&apos;s no confusion, yes my docstrings were stolen whole-hog
from jQuery.  Originality is not a goal here.</p>
