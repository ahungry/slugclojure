<h1>cells-gtk3</h1>

<p>This is a fork of <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/cells-gtk/" >cells-gtk3</a>, which is a binding for GTK+ widget toolkit using Cells3. I have not substantially modified it, mostly made it run with current versions of dependencies and modified the FFI layer to use type synonyms.</p>

<h1>Dependencies</h1>

<p>The system builds against version of dependencies in <a href="http://www.quicklisp.org/" >Quicklisp</a>. Quicklisp contains all Lisp side dependencies. Obviously, you need GTK+ installed (tested with gtk+-2.20.1), and whatever other extensions you want (mostly <a href="http://gtkglext.sourceforge.net/" >gtkglext</a>).</p>

<h3>Required</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://github.com/Ramarren/cells/tree/master" >cells</a></li>
<li><a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/cffi/" >cffi</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Optional</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/bordeaux-threads/" >bordeaux-threads</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/tpapp/cl-cairo2/tree/master" >cl-cairo2</a></li>
<li><a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-opengl/" >cl-opengl</a></li>
</ul>

<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>Note that both cells and cells-gtk3 have multiple <code>.asd</code> files in top level directory. All must be linked into central registry. </p>

<p>By default are optional dependencies are turned on. If you want optional components not to be loaded you have to edit the <code>features.lisp</code> file in cells-gtk3 directory, and comment out appropriate <code>(pushnew ...)</code> command.</p>

<h1>Documentation</h1>

<p>Cells themselves are documented in <a href="http://github.com/stefano/cells-doc/tree/master" >cells-doc</a>. There is no documentation for cells-gtk3, but there is comprehensive example application in test-gtk subdirectory.</p>

<h1>Status</h1>

<p>I cleaned up the library just in case I needed GUI in Lisp, but it turned out that I did not. Hence, the primary extent of my testing is running test-gtk:gtk-demo application. Bug reports and/or patches are welcome.</p>

<p>From my testing, the example application runs on:</p>

<h3>x86 linux</h3>

<ul>
<li>SBCL 1.0.45 (tested with threading, it has been reported on the mailing list that 1.0.20 doesn&apos;t work)</li>
<li>CLISP 2.47-r2</li>
<li>ECL 9.12.3 (with threads and unicode)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Intel MacOSX</h3>

<p>I tried only X11 GTK+ from MacPorts. It should be possible to use Quartz based version of GTK just by changing library names, but I have not tried it. There is not GTK-GL extension for Quartz.</p>

<ul>
<li>SBCL 1.0.30 (from MacPorts)</li>
<li>CCL 1.3 (from MacPorts)</li>
</ul>
