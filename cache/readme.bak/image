<p>Image is an image-drawing with a few drawing primitives (circles, ellipses, 
lines, rectangles, text). It currently has code for &ldquo;dumping&rdquo; an image to 
either X11 drawables or GIF files (via Skippy). It currently only has a single
font available for drawing text, but it should be possible to extend the font 
handling to load fonts from other formats. </p>

<p>NOTE: Now image does not support export to X11 image. It&apos;s an optional feature,
You can eval (push :support-clx <em>features</em>) to enable this feature.</p>
