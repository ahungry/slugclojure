<h1>blackbird</h1>

<p>A standalone promise implementation for Common Lisp. This is the successor to
the now-deprecated cl-async-future project.</p>

<p>Its goal is to provide an abstraction around synchronous and asynchronous code
in a way that&apos;s natural to regular lisp programming. This is ideal for both
writing drivers that can handle both blocking and non-blocking sockets, as well
as various threading operations that have the concept of a delayed result.</p>
