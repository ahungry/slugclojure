<p>Latex-table is a simple library for writing vectors and matrices into
LaTeX tables.  Just use labeled-vector-(horizontal|vertical) or
labeled-matrix to write out vectors, and labeled-matrix for matrices.
You can specify the number of significant digits (either as a single
value for all columns, or for each column separately) and the
horizontal/vertical lines.  For the latter, you can use position-type
pairs, eg</p>

<p>:hlines &apos;(0 2 -1 1))</p>

<p>will put a double line on the left hand side of the table, and a
single one on the right - negative numbers count from the right.</p>

<p>The macro with-table puts a table environment around your table.</p>

<p>This version of the package uses David Carlisle&apos;s dcolumn LaTeX
package for alignment on the decimal dot.</p>

<p>You can use raw-tabular to access the underlying function that
actually generates all the tables, but then you have to preprocess
your output yourself (read the docstring, or look at the examples).</p>

<p>Examples are in the examples/ directory.</p>
