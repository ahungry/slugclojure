<h1>Racer</h1>

<p>Racer is a knowledge representation system that implements a highly optimized tableau calculus for the description logic SRIQ(D). Racer is provided with a BSD-3 license (see the file LICENSE.txt).</p>

<p>In order to compile and load Racer inside Common Lisp use
Quicklisp or ASDF directly. Make sure ASDF finds the file racer.asd, e.g., with by evaluating something like <code>(pushnew #P&quot;~/Downloads/racer-master/&quot; asdf:*central-registry*)</code> and execute <code>(asdf:load-system &quot;racer&quot;)</code>. With Quicklisp you can use <code>(ql:quickload &quot;racer&quot;)</code>. </p>

<p>Racer has been tested with ACL 8.2, CCL 1.9, LW 6.1, and SBCL 1.1.8.
All Racer forms are available from the package racer. See the doc directory for a User&apos;s Guide and a Reference Manual. In order to start the Racer server using ACL, CCL, or LW, just execute <code>(racer:racer-toplevel)</code></p>
