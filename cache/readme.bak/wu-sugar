<p>wu-sugar is a small Common Lisp utility library to cut down on keystrokes. It might be similar in spirit to Alexandria, but is very minimalist.</p>

<p>The following functions are defined:
* <strong>&amp;</strong>: sugar for (concatenate &apos;string &hellip;)
* <strong>join</strong>: concatenates strings, joining them by a separator character
* <strong>split</strong>: splits a string (e.g. a comma-separated string)
* <strong>starts-with-p</strong>: tests if a sequence begins with a particular subsequence
* <strong>ends-with-p</strong>: tests if a sequence ends with a particular subsequence
* <strong>file-to-string</strong>: reads a file&apos;s contents into a string
* <strong>string-to-file</strong>: writes a string&apos;s contents into a file
* <strong>format-universal-time-iso</strong>: a format function to print iso/rfc dates
* <strong>universal-time-to-iso</strong>: returns an iso/rfc formatted date string</p>
