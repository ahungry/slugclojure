<h1>asteroids</h1>

<p>Classic asteroids arcade game in Common Lisp, using SDL.</p>

<p>Originally ported from Python by andyhd (thanks, andyhd!).
The game now has sounds, keyboard 
controls, a built-in REPL (triggered by ESC key) and is very playable.</p>

<h2>Installation (no git cloning needed)</h2>

<p>Install SBCL (or CCL) and quicklisp 
<a href="http://xach.livejournal.com/278047.html">as described here</a>)</p>

<p><b>IMPORTANT</b> - install native sdl libraries!  For linux, that means apt-get install</p>

<ul>
<li>libsdl-dev</li>
<li>libsdl-gfx1.2-dev</li>
<li>libsdl-mixer1.2-dev</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, in lisp 
(ql:quickload &ldquo;asteroids&rdquo;)
(asteroids:main)</p>

<p>Quicklisp updates monthly.  If you want the newest version, git clone this repo
into an asdf-visible directory <a href="http://xach.livejournal.com/278047.html">(see Xach&apos;s article)</a>.
  ql:quickload will load the local repo first</p>

<h2>Play Instructions</h2>

<p>The game plays like original asteroids, except instead of saucers you get 
powerups.  Ram the powerups to pick up super-missiles that go through anything,
shields, or to stop time.</p>

<p>Keyboard controls:</p>

<p>Q   - quit 
A   - rotate ship left
F   - rotate ship right
J   - thrust
SPC - fire
ESC - REPL</p>

<p>P starts the game in attract mode.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>Code has been re-organized and cleaned up.  Names have been altered
to make it more sensible and bugs fixed.  Now loading with quicklisp</p>

<p>ESC now brings you to (cla REPL.  Examine the game state, recompile anything
(carefully).</p>

<p>I also added audio using MAME asteroids samples.  lispbuilder-sdl-mixer is 
fragile and very sensitive to being (defun foo (x y)
    (declare (type integer x y))
    (logxor x y))shut down correctly in an interactive 
environment.</p>

<h2>TODO:</h2>

<ul>
<li>allow remapping of keys</li>
<li>fix pause</li>
</ul>
