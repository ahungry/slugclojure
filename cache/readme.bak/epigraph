<p>Epigraph is a common lisp package for representing graph, that is sets
of nodes that may contain edges between the various nodes.</p>

<h1>Example</h1>

<p>(defparameter <em>graph</em> 
  (let ((g (make-graph :node-test &apos;equal)))</p>

<pre><code>(loop for i from 1 below 12
   do (add-node g (concatenate 'string &quot;Node &quot; (princ-to-string i))))

(add-edge-between-nodes g &quot;Node 1&quot; &quot;Node 2&quot;)
(add-edge-between-nodes g &quot;Node 1&quot; &quot;Node 3&quot;)
(add-edge-between-nodes g &quot;Node 3&quot; &quot;Node 4&quot;)
(add-edge-between-nodes g &quot;Node 3&quot; &quot;Node 5&quot;)
(add-edge-between-nodes g &quot;Node 2&quot; &quot;Node 6&quot;)
(add-edge-between-nodes g &quot;Node 6&quot; &quot;Node 7&quot;)
(add-edge-between-nodes g &quot;Node 6&quot; &quot;Node 8&quot;)
(add-edge-between-nodes g &quot;Node 4&quot; &quot;Node 9&quot;)
(add-edge-between-nodes g &quot;Node 5&quot; &quot;Node 10&quot;)
(add-edge-between-nodes g &quot;Node 5&quot; &quot;Node 11&quot;)
(add-edge-between-nodes g &quot;Node 1&quot; &quot;Node 11&quot;)
(add-edge-between-nodes g &quot;Node 8&quot; &quot;Node 7&quot;)
g))
