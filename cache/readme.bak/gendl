<h2>Gendl®</h2>

<p>Pre-built Distributions available here: </p>

<p>http://gendl.com</p>

<p>Gendl® is a Generative Programming and Knowledge Based Engineering
framework, implementing concepts which date back to the 1980s and
which cutting-edge companies have been quietly using to gain
competitive advantage with mission-critical engineering
applications. These concepts required hundreds of thousands of dollars
investment in hardware and software just a couple decades ago. They
are now at your fingertips as an integral part of the Open-Source
ecosystem, running on commodity consumer-grade hardware.</p>

<p>Gendl allows for high-level declarative, object-oriented problem
solving and application development, including but not limited to the
ability to generate and manipulate 3D geometry. To solve a problem in
Gendl, you formulate it using the <code>define-object</code> operator, which
allows you to specify inputs, outputs (<code>computed-slots</code>), and child
objects, which then gives the ability to generate a &ldquo;tree&rdquo; of objects,
useful for decomposing complexity.</p>

<p>A graphical web-based interface, <em>tasty</em>, is available for interacting
with your system as it is developed.</p>

<p>The web-based GUI framework used to make tasty (GWL) is also available
for creating your own custom web-based user interfaces. </p>

<h3>Fundamental KBE Features Provided</h3>

<ul>
<li>Declarative (non-procedural) Syntax</li>
<li>Object and value caching (i.e. runtime memorization)</li>
<li>Dependency-tracking (cached values get recomputed when needed)</li>
</ul>

<p>Gendl ships with a full set of wireframe 3D and 2D geometry primitives
along with output <em>lenses</em> for standard browser-based viewing and
exchange formats such as PDF, SVG, X3D, PNG, as well as DXF.</p>

<p>Optionally there is available a set of surface- and solid-modeling
primitives which currently depend on SMLib, a commercial geometry
kernel available from Solid Modeling Solutions, Inc. SMLib enables the
use of standard CAD data exchange formats such as Iges, STEP, and STL
(for 3D printing). </p>

<h3>Basic Requirements:</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Common Lisp: Allegro CL 9.0, LispWorks 6.x, SBCL, or CCL (Clozure
CL). Without web interface, initial ports to ECL, ABCL, and CLISP
have also been completed. </p></li>
<li><p>Quicklisp (available from http://www.quicklisp.org)</p></li>
<li><p>Gnu Emacs (recommended Editor/IDE &ndash; native CL Editor/IDEs can
also be used)</p></li>
<li><p>Standard Web Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE, Opera). Pick
one with WebGL support if possible (check
<a href="http://www.x3dom.org/?page_id=9" >here</a> and
<a href="http://www.x3dom.org/check/" >here</a> to check for WebGL browser
support)</p></li>
<li><p>Curiosity, Creativity, and Courage</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>To load the entire system, you can do it with:</p>

<pre><code><span class="code">  <span class="paren1">(<span class="code">ql:quickload <span class="keyword">:gendl</span></span>)</span>
  <span class="paren1">(<span class="code">gendl:start-gendl!</span>)</span></span></code></pre>

<p>Now you can do a quick sanity check by visiting:</p>

<p><a href="http://localhost:9000/tasty" >http://localhost:9000/tasty</a></p>

<p>in your browser and trying to instantiate the default assembly tree
(robot).</p>

<h3>Emacs Editor/IDE Support</h3>

<p>Slime (Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs) is recommended 
for developing Gendl applications with Emacs.  </p>

<p>Slime is available with:</p>

<p>(ql:quickload :quicklisp-slime-helper)</p>

<p>`Glime&apos; is our Gendl-specific customizations to Slime. This is
implemented entirely on the swank (Common Lisp) side of things, and
can be loaded with</p>

<p><code>common-lisp
  (load (compile-file &quot;.../gendl/emacs/glime.lisp&quot;))
</code></p>

<p>Although not strictly necessary, the file <code>.../gendl/emacs/gdl.el</code> is
also provided and can be used as a starting point or reference for
loading Glime and Gendl into an emacs environment.</p>

<h3>Further Documentation</h3>

<p>Documentation is published
<a href="http://genworks.com/downloads/tutorial.pdf" >here</a>, and this very much
an active work in progress. Training tutorials and videos are also in
progress and in their current state are available in the Documentation
section on http://genworks.com.</p>

<h3>Gendl source code Architecture:</h3>

<p>Gendl is separated into layered components, some of which depend on
others. Some components also depend on third-party external libraries,
which are currently handled with the Quicklisp system.</p>

<p>At the core &ldquo;kernel&rdquo; is the <code>:gendl</code> (nickname <code>:gdl</code>) package,
implemented with files in the folder <code>gendl/base/</code>. This includes the
compiler/expanders for <code>define-object</code> and related macros as well as
core primitives such as <code>vanilla-mixin</code>.</p>

<p>Including the base, there are eight modules supported with Gendl:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>:base</code> - (gendl/base/) Gendl language kernel for compiling
 declarative object definitions and working with them at runtime.</p></li>
<li><p><code>:cl-lite</code> - (gendl/cl-lite/) For compiling and loading directory
 trees as projects. This can also generate ASDF files, and
 supplements the standard use of asdf and quicklisp.</p></li>
<li><p><code>:geom-base</code> - (gendl/geom-base/) Built-in Gendl 3D and 2D wireframe
  primitives and cartesian coordinate system for basic geometry
  generation and manipulation.</p></li>
<li><p><code>:gwl</code> - (gendl/gwl/) Generative Web Language, for representing web pages
   using GDL objects, includes Ajax-based web interaction with
   your model.</p></li>
<li><p><code>:gwl-graphics</code> - (gendl/gwl-graphics/) for including graphics
 rendered from geometry object in GWL web pages.</p></li>
<li><p><code>:surf</code> - (gendl/surf/) NURBS surface and brep/boolean solids
  primitives (these don&apos;t do much without the underlying geometry
  kernel middleware or implementation).</p></li>
<li><p><code>:tasty</code> - (gendl/apps/tasty/) web-based testing, tracking, and
   debugging utility. </p></li>
<li><p><code>:yadd</code> - (gendl/apps/yadd/) for self auto-documentation.</p></li>
<li><p><code>:regression</code> - (gdl/regression) regression test utilities and tests.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Alternative Geometry Kernels</h3>

<p>If you have a different favorite solid modeling kernel
(e.g. OpenCascade, Parasolid, Geometros sgCore), then an interesting
project would be to interface the existing Surface package to that
kernel, by implementing the methods in surf/source/methods.lisp.</p>

<p>The Surface (<code>:surf</code>) package (in the <code>surf/</code> folder) contains all the
high-level Surface and Solid modeling primitives currently implemented
in Gendl. These primitives provide a protocol for what the objects
should be able to do (i.e. what messages they should answer), but
without the SMLib library and associated middleware available, they
will not be able to return any results.  The SMLib kernel and
associated middleware are available as part of the commercial
Genworks® GDL product from <a href="http://genworks.com" >Genworks®
International</a>.</p>
